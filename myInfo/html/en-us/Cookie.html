    <h3>COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER Prokits</h3>
</div>
<div class="cookie-content">
    <p>Like most sites, Prokits uses cookies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p>
    <p>Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.</p>
    <p>Other technologies, including Web storage and identifiers associated with your device, may be used for similar purposes. In this notice, we say "cookies" to discuss all of these technologies.</p>
    <p>Because cookies are used throughout our websites, disabling them may prevent you from using certain parts of the sites.</p>
    <h5 class="text-title">HOW WE USE COOKIES</h5>
    <p>Like most providers of online services, Prokits uses cookies for a number of reasons, like helping us see which features are most popular, counting visitors to a page, improving our users' experience, keeping our services secure, and just generally providing you with a better, more intuitive, and satisfying experience. The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>
    <h5 class="text-title">STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES</h5>
    <p>These cookies are essential to enable you to browse around our websites and use their features. Without these cookies, services like member service and Distributor service cannot be provided.</p>
    <h5 class="text-title">PERFORMANCE AND ANALYTICS COOKIES</h5>
    <p>These cookies collect information about how you use our websites — for instance, which pages you go to most. This data may be used to help optimise our websites and make them easier for you to navigate.</p>
    <h5>FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES</h5>
    <p>These cookies allow our websites to remember choices you make while browsing. For instance, we may store your geographic location in a cookie to ensure that we show you our website localized for your area. We may also remember preferences such as text size, fonts and other customizable site elements. They may also be used to keep track of what featured products or videos have been viewed to avoid repetition. The information these cookies collect will not personally identify you, and they cannot track your browsing activity on non-Prokits  websites.</p>
    <h5>HOW THIRD PARTIES USE COOKIES</h5>
    <p>You may encounter cookies from third parties who also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies about your online activities, either on our services or across the Internet, for reasons like those noted above.</p>
    <p>In addition, we also may permit certain third party companies, such as Google, Amazon and Adobe, to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on our Sites and/or Services (e.g., to allow them to tailor ads on third party services). More information on these providers and their practices is available using the links, above.</p>
